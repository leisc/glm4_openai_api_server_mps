OpenAI compliance API for GLM-4-9b-chat on Mac Silicon Chip

It was great that ZhipuAi released glm-4-9b-chat and provided openai compliance API program with vllm on Nvidia/AMD GPU/CPU, but not available for Mac Silicon Chip (MPS).

So I ported it to M1 Mac.

It is still in the early stage, but it works. I will continue to test and improve it.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

### Installation
Please refer to the repo of ZhipuAi: https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4 for the installation of GLM-4-9b-chat and the openai_api_server.
